## Research Schema

### Literature mining

1. CFDA-approved drug
2. Essential herbs from the pharmacopoeia
3. Identified compounds collected from multiple TCM databases (cross-check)
4. Molecular information retrival and deduplication for the compounds

### ADMET of the compounds

1. ADMET prediction by admetSAR/admetStudio
2. ADMET comparison between prediction and database
3. Screening (criteria)

### Similarity evalutaion between two drugs

1. By chemical structure （Tanimoto coefficient）
2. By drug targets （STITCH, BATMAN-TCM and PUBCHEM）
3. By cellular function fingerprints (GO term)

### Similarity network construction

According to the similarity measure
